# Exercise Bacterial Genomics and Bioinformatics

## Getting started
This is the bioinformatics exercise for the lecture "Bacterial genomics and bioinformatics". First, download the data using the .zip download at the top of the page. In the zip file you'll find a folder called 'data'. This is what you're going to need during this exercise.

## Quality Control
Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) produces a wealth of data that needs careful processing by specialized software in order to be used to give insights in biological questions. The first step after sequencing reads are provided by the sequencer, is to get an idea of the overall quality of the data. To do this, we usually generate a quality report using the tool FastQC. In the /data/ folder, you'll find a .html file **(fastqc_report.html)**. Open this file in your web browser or [click here](/data/fastqc_report.html)
